# CHBot
CH Chain Manager

This is a bot which allows players to automatically manage the CH chain with in-game !commands, and then outputs the chain to a discord channel which can then be pasted into game

There are four commands:

!chain start = restarts the chain, clears all assignments

!chain add playername = adds playername to the next position in the chain

!chain remove playername = removes playername from the chain and brings the last person in the chain to their assignment to avoid gaps

!chain report = refreshes the chain assignment in discord

The chain will automatically refresh itself in the channel as it is altered
